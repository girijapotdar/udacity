# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## How the Game Works
Overview: Game Functionality
Your implementation must at minimum follow the basic functionality, but you can add additional optional functionality to your game, if you wish.

##Basic Functionality

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

- The player can move left, right, up and down
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
